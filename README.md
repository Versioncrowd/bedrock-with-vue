Bedrock with a simple Load More Button Vue Module

For code demostration only. 
This code wont build, but is a quick and simple demonstration of how I integrated Vue with an existing Bedrock project. 

The Vue Modules is a simple Load More Button that loads post teasers from different post types via WP Rest API. 
The template in which vue is integrated in is template-teaser-vue. 
See the script folder in /web/app/themes/my_theme/resources/assets/scripts/routes/template-teaser.
Note: Bedrock webpack needed to be modified for this to work.
